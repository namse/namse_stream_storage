점토벽돌 (roth_sam): 남세님 c랑 자료구조를 입문한후에 백준에서 알고리즘 문제만 풀고있는데 다음 진로를 못정해서 다음을 뭘해야할지 모르겠어용

Namse, I have no idea what is the next. I learned C lang and data structure and after that I just solved some algorithm problems.

알고리즘 공부하실려고 프로그래밍 시작하신거 아니죠?
You didn't start programming to study algorithms. right?

점토벽돌 (roth_sam): ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 지금은 저도 잘모르겠어요
IDK hahaha

그럼 하지 마세요 아무것도
Then don't do that anything.

목표가 없으면 이렇게 되는 것 같아요.
I believe it's because of absent of purpose.

점토벽돌 (roth_sam): 어릴때 주커버그처럼 앱을 만들어서 부자가 되고 싶었는데 그래서 인터넷 뒤져서 c언어 하라고해서 배웠고 그다음에 자료구조 공부했어요.
I used to be like a Zuckerberg, rich man, so I found that I have to learn C lang in the Internet. So did I. And Data structure also.

점토벽돌님의 목표를 잊으시면 안돼요, "앱을 만드는 것"입니다.
Don't forget purpose. your purpose is "making app".

인터넷 또 뒤지세요. 책을 찾으세요! 앱 만드는 것과 관련된 것은 무엇이든 공부해보세요!
Keep googling. Find book! Study anything which is related with making app.


카르브 (dnms445): 남세님 주변에서 한분야로 일하다 다른 분야로 넘어가시는 분들도 있나여?
Namse, do you know anyone who worked in an industry and move to another industry?

네! 저요.
Yes, Me!

지금은 아마존 가셨는데, 같이 일했던 분은 프로그래밍 언어쪽? 연구 하시다가 게임회사 오신 분도 계세요.
Now he moved to Amazon, he worked for lab about programming language, and he came to game company.

​혹시 다른 질문이긴 하지만.. 같이 하고싶은 프로젝트가있는데 혹시 카톡아이뒤 말씀드려도 될까요?
I have a project that I want to do with you namse. Could you let me know your contact?

몬데요..?
What is it?

a = b;
= 대입연산자 Equal
넣는 계산을 하는 글자

a에 b값을 넣겠다.

wesd725: 제가 js로 0을 a로 바꾸고 1을 b로 바꾸고 이렇9까지 j로 바꾸는 거 만들었는데 이것보다더 좋은 방법이 있는 지 궁금해요 ..
https://pastebin.com/jS6QwyLF

I change 0 to a and 1 to b... until 9 to j. Any other better idea than this?

```typescript

const numericCharAlphabetTuples = [
  ['0','a'],
  ['1','b'],
  ['2','c'],
  ['3','d'],
  ['4','e'],
  ['5','f'],
  ['6','g'],
  ['7','h'],
  ['8','i'],
  ['9','j'],
];

function replaceNumbersInStringToAlphabet(string) {
  numericCharAlphabetTuples.forEach(tuple => {
    const numericChar = tuple[0];
    const alphabet = tuple[1];
    string = string.replace(numericChar, alphabet);
  });

  return string;
}

```

Black_Morty: btw what are your goals and plan for this 2020?
님 2020년 목표가 무엇입니까?

1. Not having Girl Friend
  여자친구 없는 것
2. Making a prototype of any project
  아무 프로젝트의 프로토타입 완성하는 것.
3. Being Healthy
  건강
4. Diet 69kg => 66kg
  다이어트

*IMPORTANT : "Not having GF" is important.
중요 : 여자친구 안생기는 것은 중요합니다.

If you want GF, you become unnatural.
여자친구를 원하면, 안 자연스럽게 되요.

제가 좋아하는 여자 앞에서는 엄청 떨고, 부자연스러워요. 그래서 되게 부담을 주는 스타일이에요.
If I'm in front of my crush, I become so nervous and unnatural. So she may feel pressure.

그래서 애초에 좋아하지 않는게 더 가능성 있지 않을까...
So... Maybe it would be better not to like her...

PhysoTronic
- only good advice, if you like her, ask her out and dont expect nothing.
- no calculations, no expectations, just ask and see what happens
- more you think, what should I do, how she will react
- bigger chance for her to look at you as friend
- like imagine some girl being next to you
- lets say she is next to you for long time and she is good to you
- she is good to you, but never ask you out or anything like that
- you will not look at her as woman, but friend
- same goes other way
- you are spending time to show her your good side
- while somebody else will ask her directly and she will say yes because she doesnt know there is one good developer who likes her
- Im saying to not expect nothing because she will notice that you are "desperate"
- because more you want her to say yes, bigger chance you make her feel bad
- well we are man, woman brain works differently :D
- I was talking about you
-"good developer who likes her"
- I dont mean desperate literally
- you probably were in some situations when people ask you something, and you can just feel that they really really want you to say yes
- yes. thats why I told you to ask her out as soon as possible, because more you wait, more you want her to say yes
- you want to have more time to show her that you are good person, but unfortunately that works against you
- but you see problem here?
- you already have big expectations from her
- she says no to you once, and you feel bad
- and that will show on your face at some point
- dont get me wrong, Im same as you
- when they say no, I just overthink and feel like shit
- to solve that problem, you could ask her to cinema or go to walk to park or something like that
- and when you feel like you have nice moment, you tell her
- hey, i would like to tell you something, you maybe already noticed it. I really like you and if its ok with you, I would like us to hang out more and see what happens
- some shit like that
- if you say you have nice time and ask her to hang out more
- you know what is problem there?
- what is difference you saying that like her friend or love interest
- you know what is problem here, you need to show her somehow that you like her
- best way is to say to her face, hey I really like you, I dont want you to feel awkward about that, I will respect your decision
- you know, we should make it sound better, but I think that is best way
- and lets say you do it
- what can happen?
- she can Yes, and we are all happy
- or she can No and we feel bad for few days and then we go further
- more you wait, more you will hurt yourself
- to love someone, you need to spend more time with them and know them really well
- and you will solve that with telling her that you like her
- because you have expectation
- can you see issue here
- you act like friend, and you will get hurt because one day she will tell you that she only see you like friend
- I want to say something to you. I like time we spend together and I feel that I really like you. I would like you to think about it and if you agree, I would like us to spend more time and see what happens with our relationship. We might become really good friends or something more
- Like you see what Im saying here
- you will tell her everything, let her decide what she wants, friends or something more
- if she says no, you are friends and maybe in future that change
- but at least you will know where you stand
- worst thing is not knowing and wondering what could you do
- thats why you must let her know
- whatever she choose
- you will respect that decision
- you already have poker face next to her
- and if she says no, you will say okay, im sorry to hear that. Lets continue being friends
- and then you go home and buy some alcohol
- drink a little bit, feel sad
- and then you are back
- you will "release" all this shit that is inside you
- and let me ask you once question
- how will you feel about it after 10years?
- if you ask her, and everything goes to shit
- in 10 years, will you be still sad about it
- or you will laugh about it and say, at least I had balls to ask her out and smile
- you will not feel anything, she was not the one
- so the pressure you feel know, anxiety and everything, its just in your head
- sooner you ask her, sooner you will be free again
- free from all those bad feeling when you wonder what should you do to make her like you more
- you can only get yes or no from her
- no matter what she say, you will survive that and keep living
- no
- what she saw until now
- was you for everyone else
- when you tell her that you like her
- you will give her chance to see you in other way
- you understand what I want to say?
- you are not same person to your family
- for your friend, for your lover
- doesnt matter how long you know each other
- no
- dont overthink
- if she wants more time, she will ask you for more time
- if some girl comes to you and tell you she likes you
- and you feel that you need to think about it, what will you do?
- you will tell her, listen, you surprised me, can i have more time to th ink about it
- thats why I told you, when you tell her that you like her
- you must say, I would like to know how you feel about me. Do you want us to be friends or would you like us to hang out more and see where that takes us
- if you tell her "you can tell me your answer in week"
- how does that feel?
- and thats why you will not tell her that
- you said that you want to give her time
- same here
- if you want serious relationship, you will be friend for little bit
- to know each other a little bit
- bro, if you dont tell her you like her, how will she know?
- if you have 50 girls around you
- and they are with you every day
- but never say they like you
- how will you know they like you if you never ask
- its magic circle
- spend more time and show good your side -> there is never good moment to tell them you like them -> repeat
- somewhere where is not lot of people and you can talk with her without people interrupting you
- well you try few times
- if she says no every time, then you know that she doesnt want to spend time with you
- but you already said that you went to dinner and coffee together, so I dont think she will say no
- you see, more you think, more you feel bad
- sooner you ask, sooner you will feel alive again
- no project
- more you bullshit your way
- when he tells her, she will be WTF
- and if she says no
- what will she think next time when he really needs to talk to her about project?
- he is doing that shit again, he just wants to be with me
- Glovali said to say that you need to talk about project when you call her out
- your expectations are too big of her. she doesnt know that you like her. you are now one of her many friends that asked her out. she didnt had time or didnt want to go out that day out and she said no
- no expectations, ask directly and whatever happens, keep your head up because you are great
- okay lets change tactic
- reverse situation
- you hear that some girl liked you like you like that woman on your job
- what would you tell her that she should do if she liked you?
- be friend with me, spend more time with me
- or just tell me you like me and I will tell you how I feel
- noi
- that means, you are good person and I want to be friend with you
- like do you see problem of spending more time with her and not saying anything?
- you get friendzoned
- I know that we will always think, lets be friends one more week to show her how good I am and then I say I like her... then one more week, one more week
- and suddenly you are friends xD
- you asked her to be messaging friends and she said no?
- oh, I thought it was in real life
- you did good
- I would do same thing like you
- its not same
- this is internet and what you will do is real life
- if she ask you about sex and stuff like that, if that is reason why you are asking her out
- you will say, No, I like to spend time with you because it feels really nice
- oh, we are talking about when you dont want to go?
- or you went to cinema, and she asked you to be together, but you dont want?
- you will say to them, sry but I dont feel like that.
- dont complicate things, that will not happen
- and if it happens
- you will see how you feel inside
- happy? good?
- then you will say yes
- if you dont feel like saying yes, straight away. that probably means no
- no, week
- if you need to think so long about how you feel
- that already show that you dont like her that much
- like imagine, you ask girl out, but she takes 7 days to tell you yes or no
- how will you feel? does she really likes me when she needs 7 days to decide if she likes me or not
- so even if she says Yes, you will be happy first few days, but then you start thinking about it and you feel like shit
- you understand
- like when your girlfriend cheat you, and she says she is sorry and you forgive her
- you will always think about it
- does she like me enough or will she do it again
- exactly
- first big fight
- you waited 7 days to decide if you like me or not
- thats why said right away. no expectations, tell her you like her and what happens, happens. after few months you will chase some other girld :D
- thats why you MUST tell her
- okay, I dont want you to feel bad about this. we will continue being friends
- and next time you see her, you say Hi, how is your day and behave like always
- and you know what will happen?
- 2nd girl you like
- if she hears about it
- she will be like, look at Namse, he is so mature
- he got negative answer, but he didnt do anything bad or make her feel bad
- and if you ask her out
- bigger chance to say yes
- yes
- exmaple
- you hear some girl is always making show when she get No from man.
- will you talk with her or ask her out?
- no, because you dont want that shit
- okay, let me rephrase it
- you hear from other that some girl is problematic. she comes to you one day and ask you to go out. is there bigger chance for you to say yes or no?
- thats when you ask 1st girl out, you need to make sure that there is NO misunderstanding
- you need to make sure that she knows, if she says No, you will not make pressure on her to say yes or make her feel bad
- and on job, you will behave like always, no bad feelings between you
- you know, like everything good if she says No, everything good if she says yes
- exactly
- not make her feel bad if she says no

Alok37: you shouldn't ask out immediately, only if you are going on well, or if you will not see her again

- he asked her to dinner and coffee but they talked about some project
- like friends and colleges
- okay
- imagine: girl ask you out, you say no. but you work together and then she start behaving differently. she stops talking with you and things like this. how will you feel? thats why you cant do these things and you need to be ready if she says no
- thats all that friends do, if you dont say anything, it all looks like you are just good friends
- if you dont have balls to say I like you, then you will not get the girl
- because fire comes from them
- thats why you go out few times and hang out
- but you will not kiss or touch her if you dont know she doesnt like you
- no expectation. do you wanna hang out with me, there is good movie in cinema, wanna come with me
- yes
- out of blue = suddenly
- first you call her out to hang out. no expectation, just chat and see how you feel
- maybe after 2nd time you hang out with her you realize she is a bitch and you hate her
- or they can just be easy
- when you ask her to hang out, if she has boyfriend she will say no
- or you check her facebook or her social media
- not from frist No
- you ask her 3-4 times, if every time she says No and she never ask you out, then you know what she doesnt want to be with you
- you will make effort to ask them back if you want to be with them
- if not, you will say no every time
- no counting, you will see how things goes
- maybe every time she is with you she doesnt speak to you and you feel bad
- because then you cant speak with her
- if you focus only on her, other people will make joke that you only talk with her
- you can go together on break in company, chat a little bit every day and then you ask her to cinema
- it feels more that you admire her
- you will not say it like that
- you will ask her if she wants to go to cinema to watch XYZ movie
- I heard that its really good but I dont feel like going alone
- you said
- I will ask: " Do you want go to cinema with me"
- its better to ask "Hey, there is movie in cinema that I heard is really good, I dont like going alone, are you interested in that movie?"
- maybe she hates cinema or that movie
- you ask her if she is interested
- you always try to make her say what she thinks
- how do you feel about this? do you like this and
that? stuff like that
- you will get to know what she likes and you will know where to take her
- but you cant be like police, only asking questions
- when you talk with her, she says she watched some movie. you ask her if she likes that kind of movies? after that you can ask her if she like to go to cinema to watch movies?
- if she says she doesnt like cinema, you will not ask her to go to cinema with you
- you can say this
- you said you like this kind of movies, I heard there is new movie, do you want to go and see it?
- I have to go now, I wish you like with your lady. No expectations, keep it simple and thats it





2 times hanging out

1st => go together with other people << warming up
2nd => go only with her << challenge


"I want to watch movie with you"
vs
"Do you like this movie? I didn't watch yet. Go on sunday?"
